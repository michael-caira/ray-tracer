# Simple Ray Tracer
Built a simple ray tracer following this [guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to develop a stronger knowledge of graphics programming. 

Developed with an orientable camera to simulate depth of field effects and capable of rendering 3D objects with realistic lighting.
